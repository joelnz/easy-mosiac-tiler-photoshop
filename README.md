# Easy Mosaic Tiler for Photoshop

Easy Mosaic Tiler is a simple Photoshop script that allows you to create wall mosaics from a single image. You don't need any experience with Photoshop scripts to use it! The script will automatically divide your image into 6x4 inch tiles, which you can easily print at a pharmacy or drugstore photo kiosk.

The script will:

1. Ask you to provide the dimensions of the wall area you want to cover with the mosaic.
2. Scale your image to fit the specified wall area while maintaining its aspect ratio.
3. Divide the image into 6x4 inch tiles and save them as separate JPEG files.


## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the `mosaic_tiler.jsx` file from the repository.
2. Open Adobe Photoshop.

### Usage

1. Open the image you want to create a mosaic from in Photoshop.
2. Go to `File` > `Scripts` > `Browse...` and locate the downloaded `mosaic_tiler.jsx` file.
3. The script will prompt you to enter the width and height of the wall (in inches) you want to create a mosaic for.
4. Select a folder where you want to save the 6x4 inch tile JPEG files.
5. The script will generate the tiles and save them in the selected folder.

Now, simply take the exported JPEG files to your nearest pharmacy or drugstore photo kiosk and print your 6x4 inch tiles. Assemble the printed tiles on your wall to create the mosaic!
